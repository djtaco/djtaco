      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite movies is Donnie Darko. I love the score, I love the soundtrack, I love it all (the Director&amp;rsquo;s Cut does &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; exist). The 80s soundtrack mixed with a beautifully composed score companies an amazing film. Though it is a bit out of date, I deem a review necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s 2005, as a young adult in college, I found myself at a college apartment at a friend&amp;rsquo;s apartment. As most might do in my position would do, I indulged in some adult beverages. With a cozy group, I found that my inhibitions were thrown right out the window. With an evil glare, I watched the girl I thought who was interested into me gingerly flirt with my nemesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do I do next? Well, I do what any other self-respecting, jealous, anger filled adult would do. Tuck my tail between my legs, head out to my car, and listen to the full custom Donnie Darko Score and Soundtrack mix. After more than an hour of random friends and strangers confronting me through a knock at my window, I ignore in a blind bliss of Michael Andrews serenading me. This music was made for me in this moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I exited my aural portal, I returned to reality. Calm, collected, joyous. I was ready to return to the party. With purpose, I opened the door to my car, popped my trunk, and stripped down in the parking lot. I pull the hockey bag from my trunk, and suited up. Accompying me as I walked up the steps towards the apartment, were sounds of Robocop (that I created from my mouth), mimicing his movement as I stormed through the door. Everyone was asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was Robocop. Walking the walk, and talking the talk. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t for the people, as my audience was asleep. This was my artistic expression that was spawned from the album I listened to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editors note:
I was unaware anyone was really awake as I took out these actions. I scanned the room as if I was Robocop, making all the authentic sounds. One sleepy onlooker stifled their laugh I found out later.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next thing I know, the sun blinded me as I took in the stench of my hockey equipment. Sprawled out, inverted, on the stairs, the resident of the apartment stepped over me as they left for work. I could only muster up a small wave, before I closed my eyes with a smile on my face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I give the Donnie Darko Soundtrack / Score a 4.5 out of 5.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The tablet you never knew you had</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is not so surprising that a new Apple iPad is just around the corner. Many are assuming that it is the Pro version. Bigger screen, multitasking, maybe even a dedicated stylus. Sure, these features scream &lt;em&gt;productivity in a light package&lt;/em&gt;, but that is only assumptions. Who wants to wait a couple months for the actual product?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to do some investigation on which was the right tablet. I wanted something in the Apple ecosystem, as that is where all my other tech products reside. I wish the iPad Air 2 was just a tad bit more capable. What I really want, is to be able to take my slim, light, portable Macbook and push the screen all the way back and use it as a tablet. Hmm, a tablet mode? Surely Apple didn&amp;rsquo;t hide this feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low and behold, the Macbook is also a tablet! Hear me out. It seems scary when you push the screen back, especially when you hit that first point of resistance. You get the sense that it is going to destroy your shiny new laptop. I assure you, once you get past that first hurdle, which coincidentally sounds like an out-of-place cracking, the fun begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a now smooth flowing hinge, and the screen in the position underneath the keyboard, tablet mode is activated! No wonder tapping on the screen did nothing until now. I can swipe and gesture on the beta version of El Capitan with not a single issue. A fully functioning OS X tablet seems too amazing to hide from the consumers. What is even more baffling is they honed El Capitan (tablet mode) to accurately detect pressure and strokes from &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; pen or pencil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you all find this as exciting and useful as I did. Share this features with your friends. Pull out your fanciest fountain pen, and go to town on the best new tablet on the market. You will not be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
